About
I am a passionate mobile app developer with over 7 years of professional experience in Android development (Flutter, Java, Kotlin). I have a deep understanding of the complete Android app development lifecycle and a growing enthusiasm for Kotlin Multi-Platform, which I recently fell in love with.

My expertise includes:

Mobile Development: Proficient in Java, Kotlin, and Dart for creating seamless and efficient Android applications.
Cross-Platform Development: Skilled in building dynamic mobile apps using Flutter and KMP.
Backend Development: Experienced in API development with Laravel and MySQL.

I’m committed to adhering to best coding practices and architectural standards like MVVM, MVC, and Clean Architecture ensuring quality, scalability, and maintainability in every project I undertake. A strong believer in teamwork, I enjoy collaborating with others and have experience leading small groups to deliver projects on time without compromising quality.
